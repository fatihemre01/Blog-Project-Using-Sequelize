# Blog-Project-Using-Sequelize
I've used pure sql statements in this project before. Now I've used sequelize instead. It's really more easy to write sequelize codes over pure SQL statements in the project. And project codes looks much cleaner and nicer anymore. That's an awesome technology! It basicially enables us to write javascript(sequelize) methods and it converts these methods into a language that RDBM can actually understand which is SQL :)  So we can foucus on our project more easily...
