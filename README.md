# Blog-Project-Using-Sequelize
I've used pure sql statements in this project before. Now I've used sequelize instead. And project code become %50 much less :D That's an awesome technology! It basicially enables us to write javascript methods and it convert these methods into a language that RDBM can understand which is SQL :)
